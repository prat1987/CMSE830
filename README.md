![Alt text](https://www.globalcarbonproject.org/nitrousoxidebudget/20/files/NitrousOxideInfographic2020.png)

**Title**: <b/>Tool for data analysis and run Machine learning models<b/>

**Author**: Prateek Sharma

**Special Thanks**: Prof. Murillo (Department of Computational Mathematics, Science and Engineering)

**Utility**:N2O is one of the major greenhouse gases with a global warming potential (GWP) of 273 (Â± 118) times 
    more than carbon dioxide (CO2) for a 100-year time scale. This web app will let the user 
    explore the relationship between several variables measured and N2O emissions for a experiment using visualization and ML models which will help them to 
    understand the major factors impacting greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from agricultural soil
